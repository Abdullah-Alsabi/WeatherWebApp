<h1> Responsive Weather Web Application  </h1>

<h4>Hello Everyone   </h4> <br>
I did this project for Tuwaiq 1000 first project. <br>
<br>
<q>The Tuwaiq Programming embraces beginners through nurturing and training them from scratch,  <br>
giving professionals an opportunity to reÔ¨Åne their programming skills, and opening doors to those who are interested in learning new skills,<br>
building websites or designing applications for their startup business ideas.</q><br>

<h2> Application description:  </h2>

<p>This application helps user to find the weather status. <br>
Some of the services in this app:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get weather status for more than 200,000 city around the world.</li>
<li>Add and remove cities from the watch list.</li>
<li>Two differnt themes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools:</h2>
<p>I used many tools to build this application. <br>
Some of the tools I used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML & CSS & JS.</li>
<li>I used BootStrap to make the application responsive.</li>
<li>Also I used Figma to design the application.</li>
<li>And to track the progress and tasks I used Trllo.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Obstacles:</h2>
One of the proplem I faced is to find the API that fits my requirement, and after a lot of searching I found the OpenWeatherMap API which is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data via API, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any geographical location.

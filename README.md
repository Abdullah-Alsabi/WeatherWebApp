# WeatherWebApp

Hello Every one <3

In this application users can find updated weather status.

And users can add cities to the watch list to get the weather status quickly.

The tool I used to design is Figma and I used trello to track the tasks.

One of the proplem I faced is to find the API that fits my requirment, and after a lot of searching I found the OpenWeatherMap API.

# WeatherWebApp

Hello Every one <3

In this application user can found updated weather status.

And user can add cities to his list to get the weather status.

The tools I used is Figma to design the UI and I used trello to track the tasks.

One of the proplem I faced is to find the API that fits my requirment, and after a lot of searching I found the OpenWeatherMap API.
